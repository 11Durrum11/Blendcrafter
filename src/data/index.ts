/**
 * Aggregate data barrel: every picker in the app reads from these ALL_*
 * collections, which merge the legacy core packs (src/data/classes.ts,
 * src/data/races.ts, src/data/templates.ts) with the full core roster packs
 * (src/data/core/*). Records are deduplicated by id, first pack wins.
 *
 * The optional ruleset packs (Eberron / Iron Kingdoms / Sorcery &
 * Steam) were never recovered from the truncated GitHub archives;
 * they were rebuilt from Shaun's own books in 2026-10 (see
 * REBUILD-NOTES.md addenda) and are merged alongside the core packs.
